# Vocabulary Practice

Vocabulary words, meanings and flashcards for GRE preparation

Words are taken from the [Kaplan test prep](https://www.kaptest.com/study/gre/top-52-gre-vocabulary-words/) and [PrepScholar](https://www.prepscholar.com/gre/blog/gre-vocabulary-list-words/) websites as well as a few more added by me that I found while practicing.

# AWA Issues

ETS has provided the pool of topics for [issue](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/issue/pool) and [argument](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing/argument/pool) tasks which contain all the possible prompts that can come in the AWA section of the test. The AWA extractor randomly choses one of the topics from the specified pool and prints it for the user to practice.

All the topics in the data file are from the ETS website and property of ETS.
